Basicaly empty repo created only for testing how to set-up [GitHub Actions][gh-actions] to
generate simple [Hugo][hugo] site, and publish it on [GitHub Pages][gh-pages] with 
custom domain managed by [home.pl][home.pl].

> **NOTE:** As [theme for Hugo][hugo-theme] was added as Git submodule remember to add
> `--recurse-submodules` param when cloning this repo. Or exec `git submodule init` and 
> `git submodule update` after cloning without the param.
